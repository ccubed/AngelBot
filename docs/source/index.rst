Features
========

- Discord Bot
- Modular (It's easy for others to add functionality)
- Per Server Permissions
- Automated Error Reporting
- Supports Oauth flows in various APIs

What is this
============

A discord bot called AngelBot. AngelBot started as a FFXIV bot but has steadily grown into a complicated, sophisticated API machine. Currently it supports AniList, XIVDB and obviously Discord through Discord.py. Hummingbird is coming soon with plans to add the LCBO Alcohol database next and a FF XIV Lodestone parser after that. It also currently supports a small bit of the Github API but only for adding issues to my github automatically upon encountering errors.

Running
=======

Well with the new API you no longer need a locally running copy. If you DM the bot, it assumes you want an Oauth link to the addbot flow and will respond with that. So to get the bot going on your server send a DM to AngelBot#7020.


Usage
=====

Usage has per server settings now. This is written. See configuration.

Global Commands
===============

Part of configuration.

Where's Music
=============

I used to have a music portion, but it's gone now. There's a minor controversy over most of the music playing bots and for the moment it seems the best practice is to just not do it.
