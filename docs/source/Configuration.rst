Configuration
=============

The bot no longer requires configuration of individual modules. Instead you simply start with all modules enabled by default with a prefix of $. If you wish to change the prefix read below. If you wish to restrict AngelBot to certain channels please use roles and restrict AngelBot's read messages permissions. AngelBot will only respond to channels where she can read the messages.

Prefix
------

You can define a server wide prefix to use besides $. This is mostly for compatibility with other bots. AngelBot is pretty chill, use what you want.

ardserver prefix:[value]
    Set the command prefix to [value]. That means you would type [value] before every command in these documents.
    Ex: ardserver prefix:^
