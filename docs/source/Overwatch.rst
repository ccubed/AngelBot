Overwatch
=========

This module allows you to grab stats for battletags across the US or EU regions. Or at least it would if It was enabled. The code exists though, so I'm writing the documentation now in the hopes that the OWAPI that I rely on will someday be more reliable. Right now it's not reliable at all.

**Note**: TLDR: This isn't enabled. The code exists. When OWAPI becomes production ready I will turn it on.

Features
--------

ow <battletag>
    Pull stats for a battletag. Can be EU or US.

owheroes <battletag>
    Pull stats for top 5 most played heroes for a battletag

owhero <battletag>:<hero>
    Pull stats for a specific hero for a battletag. This is where the easter eggs are. See if you can find some of my funny names for the heroes. Also accepts IDs.
    Course you can also just go look at my source and find the names, but that's no fun.
